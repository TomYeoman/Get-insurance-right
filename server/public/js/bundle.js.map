generic term covering a range of insurance products that protect individuals and their families from a loss of income caused by extended periods of sickness, disability or unemployment.</p>\r\n                  <p>Many people wrongly assume the Welfare State will provide for them in times of need, but the reality is that the <strong>State benefits</strong> available <strong>only provide a very basic level of support</strong> and therefore most people in the UK should have additional income protection insurance in place to maintain their existing standards of living if they become sick or endure a disability as a result of an accident.</p>\r\n                  <p>The hard facts* are these:</p>\r\n                  <ul>\r\n            \t\t\t\t<li>2.2 million people of working age will be off work for at least 6 months at any one time through sickness or disability</li>\r\n            \t\t\t\t<li>Over 1.7 million people are claiming Income Support</li>\r\n            \t\t\t\t<li>Over 2.5 million people are claiming Incapacity Benefit</li>\r\n            \t\t\t\t<li>Over 2.6 million people are claiming Disability Living Allowance</li>\r\n            \t\t\t</ul>\r\n                  <p>(Source: Department of Work and Pensions)</p>\r\n                  <p>Employers, large and small, can and do provide a lot of <strong>employee benefits</strong>in addition to the monthly salary, and some will provide discretionary benefits in times of great need, but not all do this beyond 4 weeks and not all outcomes will necessarily be covered, so it is important to provide some level of protection yourself, even if it is a top-up to State Benefits and existing employee benefits.</p>\r\n                  <p>There are two main types of insurance policies associated with Income Protection:</p>\r\n                  <p>1. Long Term Income Protection, also known as Permanent Health Insurance</p>\r\n                  <p>2.

The other option is to simply apply for a level term policy on the basis that over time the policy will be increasingly geared towards the additional family protection element as the value of the outstanding mortgage loan decreases, and at the same time it will cover increases in inflation.</p>\r\n                  <p>These types of policies can never be cancelled by the insurer and most will allow you to make several claims so long as the circumstances are legitimate.
